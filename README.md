# HangmanGame
This project is a text-based Hangman game developed in Python. It allows users to play the classic Hangman game with different word categories.
# Project Structure
The HangmanGame project is organized around several key Python files, each serving a specific function:

hangman.py: This is the main entry point of the application, containing the game logic and user interface for interacting with the game.
word_database.py: This module manages a database of words, organized by category, that are used as the secret words for the game.
api_spec_and_tasks.md,system_design.md: These markdown files contain the API specification and system design documentation for the Hangman game project respectively.
# Features

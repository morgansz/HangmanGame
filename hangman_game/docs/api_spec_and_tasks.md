## Required Python third-party packages:

```python
"""
flask==1.1.2
bcrypt==3.2.0
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages:

```python
"""
No third-party ...
"""
```

## Full API spec:

```python
"""
openapi: 3.0.0
...
description: A JSON object ...
"""
```

## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main"),
    ("hangman.py", "HangmanGame"),
    ("word_database.py", "WordDatabase"),
    ("user_interface.py", "UserInterface")
]
```

The dependencies between the files are as follows:
- `main.py` depends on `hangman.py`, `word_database.py`, and `user_interface.py`
- `hangman.py` depends on `word_database.py`
- `user_interface.py` depends on `hangman.py`

## Task list:

```python
[
    "word_database.py",
    "hangman.py",
    "user_interface.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

The tasks should be done in the following order:
1. Implement `word_database.py`
2. Implement `hangman.py`
3. Implement `user_interface.py`
4. Implement `main.py`

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
'hangman.py' contains the implementation of the HangmanGame class, which handles the logic of the Hangman game.
'word_database.py' contains the implementation of the WordDatabase class, which provides a word database for the game.
'user_interface.py' contains the implementation of the UserInterface class, which handles the user interface for the game.
'main.py' is the entry point of the program and orchestrates the interaction between the game logic and the user interface.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR:

We need to clarify how to start the program and initialize any necessary third-party libraries.
